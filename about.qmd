I’m an engineer at heart. I grew up working in construction, earned a degree in Applied Statistics and Computer Science from BYU, and have spent more than a decade building software across diverse domains—ranging from DoD satellites (image processing, optimization) and large-scale cybersecurity analytics (petabyte-scale ML) to network engineering, monitoring, and data platforms. Today, my focus is on designing data architectures and pipelines for modeling, simulation, and analysis of large-scale systems. I’m currently pursuing a master’s in Data Analytics Engineering at GMU.

My name is Sean Reilly, and I currently work at CyberData Technologies, Inc. as a Business Analyst. I am also a Swim Coach for Streamline Swim Club. I graduated Lafayette College in Spring 2024 with a BS in Math and Minor in Data Science. While at Lafayette College, I was a Division 1 swimmer for all 4 years. I am a detail-oriented problem solver with a strong foundation in data analysis, data modeling, analytical thinking, communication, and collaboration. I had the amazing opportunity to take the position as my community summer swim team’s Head Coach for 3 summers while in college, pursuing a passion of mine, giving back to my community, and developing valuable skills along the way including leadership, interpersonal skills, organizational skills, and written communication.
