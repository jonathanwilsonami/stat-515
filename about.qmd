Iâ€™m simply an engineer. I started in construction growing up, earned an undergraduate BYU degree in Applied Statistics & Computer Science, spent over a decade building software in areas such as DoD satellites (image processing, optimization), cybersecurity (petabyte-scale analytics, ML), network engineering & monitoring and data platforms. Today I design data architectures and pipelines for modeling and analyzing large scale systems. At GMU I'm pursuing a degree in Data Analytics Engineering.
