## Abstract
Do this at the end...Just a summary section on what this paper is about...

## Introduction & Background

### Motivation
Over the past few decades, technological output has risen steadily. That gradual climb transformed into exponential growth with the advent of cloud computing, and now with the acceleration of the AI era that trajectory is poised to surge even faster. This rapid expansion is widely recognized. What’s far less understood, however, is the critical infrastructure that makes all of it possible. At the center of this digital revolution lies the often overlooked backbone of modern society: the power grid. It is the heartbeat of every computation, the lifeblood behind the flow of ones and zeros. Without this essential utility—something most of us rarely think about—the modern world as we know it would come to a halt. And no where is that more true than in the state of Virginia. 

### Virginia's Internet & Data Boom
Over the past several decades, Virginia has evolved from a strategically located government corridor into the epicenter of the modern internet. This transformation began in the early 1990s, when the Metropolitan Area Exchange–East (MAE-East)—one of the original four Network Access Points funded by the National Science Foundation—was established in Northern Virginia. Its proximity to federal agencies and research institutions such as DARPA, whose ARPANET project laid the foundations for the internet, positioned the region as a natural hub for digital networks. Over time, transatlantic subsea cable systems like MAREA-BRUSA, landing in Virginia Beach, further strengthened the state's role in global connectivity [@data-center-capital].

Today, that historical advantage has scaled into an unmatched concentration of data centers, making Virginia the digital heart of the world. An estimated 70% of global internet IP traffic is created in or routed through Loudoun County’s famed “Data Center Alley,” cementing Ashburn as the world’s central point for cloud and interconnection [@dawn-of-data]. Virginia now hosts the largest cluster of data centers anywhere on Earth—surpassing Texas, California, and Illinois—with rapid expansion fueled by skyrocketing demand for cloud computing, AI workloads, and global digital services [@cushman]. This boom is supported in part by Dominion Energy’s historically competitive electricity prices, which helped attract and retain power-intensive facilities. But it also places unprecedented strain on the state’s power grid: the very infrastructure that sustains the flow of computation. As AI and cloud demands continue to accelerate, Virginia’s electricity consumption is set to become one of the most consequential factors shaping both its economic future and the stability of its energy systems [@data-center-capital].

### Virginia's Power Demands & Hyperscaler's Damnd for Data
Virginia’s data center ecosystem has expanded at an unprecedented pace, driven largely by the accelerating demand for cloud computing and AI workloads. With more than 24,000 megawatts of planned data center capacity, Virginia surpasses every other market in the world—by more than a factor of three—in total expected power demand [@cushman]. This explosive growth reflects the state’s long-standing role as the heart of global internet traffic, as well as its strategic appeal to the companies building the modern digital economy. Nowhere is this more evident than in Northern Virginia, where annual data center absorption has shattered global records; the region reached 270 MW of bookings in 2018, while no other market worldwide has ever exceeded 70 MW in a single year [@dawn-of-data].

At the center of this surge are the hyperscalers^[A hyperscaler is a company that operates massive-scale data centers to provide large-scale cloud computing services, like computing, storage, and networking, that can be rapidly scaled to meet fluctuating demand.] major cloud and platform providers such as Microsoft, Google, Meta (Facebook), Apple, Oracle, IBM, Yahoo!, LinkedIn, Alibaba, Uber, and Dropbox. These companies require immense and rapidly scalable infrastructure, with hyperscale leases often ranging from 10 to 20 megawatts or more for a single deployment. Their adoption of point-of-delivery architectures and other repeatable, modular design patterns has enabled them to scale at a pace unmatched in the industry. The resulting demand for data is fueled by the relentless expansion of e-commerce, wireless networks, social media, streaming content, SaaS platforms, artificial intelligence, machine learning, gaming, virtual reality, and the Internet of Things. Collectively, these forces make Virginia not just a data center leader, but the world’s central engine for digital power consumption [@data-center-capital].

### The Fragile Power Grid

The power grid is essentially a giant, interconnected system that moves electricity from where it’s generated to where it’s needed. Power plants feed electricity into long-distance high-voltage transmission lines, which deliver power to substations where transformers reduce the voltage for safe distribution to homes, businesses, and—more recently—massive data centers. Because electricity cannot be stored easily at grid scale, supply and demand must remain in perfect balance at every moment. This requires constant coordination among utilities, transmission operators, and regional balancing authorities to maintain stability. When demand surges faster than supply, the grid becomes stressed, increasing the risk of brownouts or outages [@power-grid].

This balancing act becomes especially challenging in states like Virginia, where hyperscale data centers consume tens of megawatts each—orders of magnitude more than typical commercial users. As Virginia has become home to the world’s largest concentration of data centers, the strain on its power system has expanded accordingly. Each new facility adds continuous, around-the-clock demand that the grid must support without interruption. This is why long-term planning for new generation, transmission upgrades, and regional reliability is becoming central to Virginia’s energy future: the digital infrastructure powering cloud computing, AI, and global internet traffic can only grow if the physical grid underneath it can keep up.

To understand how these pressures play out across the country, it is helpful to situate Virginia within the broader structure of the United States energy landscape. The graphic below shows the U.S. Census Regions and Divisions, which group the nation into four major regions and nine divisions commonly used for national energy, economic, and demographic analysis.

### What Our Research Contributes 

Taken together, Virginia’s outsized role in global internet infrastructure, the explosive growth of hyperscale data centers, and the increasing fragility of the power grid form the backdrop for the analysis that follows. As demand for AI, cloud computing, and digital services accelerates, understanding how this demand translates into regional electricity usage becomes critical—not only for Virginia but for the nation. This study seeks to examine how Virginia’s utilities compare to those across the United States, identify whether data-center-driven growth produces distinctive load patterns, and explore the emerging pressures placed on the grid as a result. By combining national utility data with Virginia-specific trends, our goal is to measure where Virginia stands today, how its electricity profile is changing, and what these shifts may imply for energy planning, reliability, and the future of the digital economy.

## Related Works 

As shown in recent studies [@texas-power-demand], data centers significantly increase load.

TODO: Discuss 3 (already selected) other studies and approaches that have been used to understand these issues. How does our reserach differ and what new contributions do we have to add? 

## Data 

### Dataset Overview

For this analysis we used the Annual Electric Power Industry Report (Form EIA-861) which is a U.S. government survey (considered the Census for Utilities) conducted by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) that collects detailed data from electric utilities on retail sales, revenue, and other key aspects of the electric power industry. It provides information on energy sources, demand-side management, net-metering, and other operational data to help monitor the industry's status and trends [@original-eia-data]. 

Originally we wanted to know about the impact of data centers in local communities in northern VA, had reached out to several city planners, they responded back but revealed that getting specific data on individual data centers would require coordination with individual commercial power supply companies and the individual data centers themselves which would be difficult or impossible to obtain given various NDAs that would need to be signed and potential limitations on what we could share. Alas, the annually released data that is generated compiled by the EIA contains the main companies we are interested in at least their bulk aggregated numbers which will be discussed later. For example, doing a little research on line revealed that the utility named Virginia Electric & Power Co whcih is found in the data is really part of Dominion Energy which is one of the biggest power utilities in Virginia. The dataset also allows for studying behavioral indicators identifying utilities that exhibit data center like pattern such as:

- High commercial load
- Rapid growth
- High purchased-power dependency
- High demand intensity (kWh/customer)

### Limitations 

The dataset does have some obvious limitations. For one, we are looking at a yearly aggregation of data which masks some of the. Some private commercial companies might not have released certain data in the survey which might leave gaps in the analysis and greatly impact the value of our models. Despite these limitations, the EIA-861 data has been used in several analysis reports and can be viewed as a reliable data source for understanding macro trends seen in the United States power grid. 

### Data Cleaning, Processing & Assumptions 

We initially started our analysis on the 2017 EIA-861 curated dataset developed by the CORGIS Dataset Project [@data-dictionary]. However, when comparing the numbers for 2017 to the original data source the numbers were off. This might have been due to updates to upstream data that never reached the curated dataset. After this discovery we created a python script to regenerate the same exact dataset (same fields as the CORGIS Dataset) not only for 2017 but for 10 years worth of data. So 2015 to 2015. This script basically parsed each of the zipped files from source and extracted data from 3 different schedules: 

1. **Operational Data** - The data containing aggregate operational data for the source and disposition of energy and revenue information from each electric utility.
2. **Utility Data** - The data contain information on a utility’s North American Electric Reliability (NERC) regions of operation. The data also indicate a utility’s independent system operator (ISO) or regional transmission organization (RTO) and whether that utility is engaged in any of the following activities: generation, transmission, buying transmission, distribution, buying distribution, wholesale marketing, retail marketing, bundled service, or operating alternative-fueled vehicles.
3. **Sales to Ultimate Customers** - The data contain revenue, sales (in megawatthours), and customer count of electricity delivered to end-use customers by state, sector, and balancing authority. A state, service type, and balancing authority-level adjustment is made for non-respondents and for customer-sited respondents.

When it comes to data cleaning we had to handle the following and make some assumptions: 

- In EIA-861 spreadsheets a dot (.) could represent data that was suppressed (as mentioned before with private companies), not available, or did not meet a certain threshold value. For these values we decided to make zero but might use soem form of data imputation to fill these in. 
- We found only a handful of empty values in the state field. We dropped these rows as knowing where the utility is located was critical to the analysis.
