## Abstract
...Just a summary section on what this paper is about...

Today, the region is known as "Data Center Alley," and an estimated 70% of the world's internet traffic flows through it, with the boom continuing due to demands from AI and cloud computing. 

The years between 2015 and 2023 saw a %500 increase

## Introduction & Background

TODO: provide the main motivaitons and background 
Virginia has historically been the internet backbone of the United States. Currently the largest data center ally in the world. "70% of internet IP traffic is either created or passes through Loudoun County’s “Data Center Alley,” making Ashburn the epicenter for global interconnection."

In 1992, a consortium of private companies founded Metropolitan Area Exchange, East (MAE-East). A year later, the National Science Foundation awarded MFS/MAE-East a grant, establishing it as one of four original Network Access Points, along with Chicago, San Francisco, and Pennsauken, N.J.

Hossein Fateh, CEO and co-founder of DFT, provided the original hyperscalers (e.g. Yahoo!, Microsoft, and Facebook) a revolutionary infrastructure design: point-of-delivery architecture, a repeatable design pattern that maximizes scalability.

"Hyperscale leases can be massive, often 10MW to 20MW or much larger, which drove a record 270MW of bookings in Northern Virginia during 2018." no other data center market in the world has ever exceeded 70MW of annual absorption. “hyperscale” companies that have a significant presence in Virginia, including Microsoft Azure/Office 365, Facebook, Alphabet’s Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, Apple, Alibaba, Yahoo!, Uber, LinkedIn, and Dropbox, The relentless growth of data continues to be driven by e-commerce, wireless networks, social media, streaming content, software as a service, artificial intelligence, machine learning, virtual reality, gaming and machine-to-machine communication, also known as the Internet of Things (IoT).

Investor-owned utility (IOU). Main supplier for most of Northern Virginia and the state as a whole. Often abbreviated DEV by regulators.

Virginia was well-positioned to be a hub for the early internet because of its proximity to the federal government in Washington, D.C., and the research institution now known as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. In the 1960s, the agency led a project to develop ARPANET, a computer network that was a building block for the internet.
Dominion Energy, Virginia’s biggest electric utility, played a role in attracting this new development by offering competitive electricity prices to big power users, which were lower than those in many competing markets.

As shown in recent studies [@texas-power-demand], data centers significantly increase load.

## Data 

The Annual Electric Power Industry Report (Form EIA-861) is a U.S. government survey (considered the Census for Utilities) conducted by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) that collects detailed data from electric utilities on retail sales, revenue, and other key aspects of the electric power industry. It provides information on energy sources, demand-side management, net-metering, and other operational data to help monitor the industry's status and trends. 

Original Data Source [@original-eia-data]. 
Cleaned up Data Source [@dataset].

Originally we wanted to know about the impact of data centers in local communities in northern VA, had reached out to several city planners, they responded back but revealed that getting specific data on individual data centers would require coordination with individual commercial power supply companies and the individual data centers themselves which would be difficult or impossible to obtain given various NDAs that would need to be signed and various other issues related to revealing trade secrets. Alas, the data that is generated from EIA is perfect for studying behavioral indicators identifying utilities that exhibit data center like pattern such as:

- High commercial load
- Rapid growth
- High purchased-power dependency
- High demand intensity (kWh/customer)

The reveals some limitations we will have to admit....
Some private commercial companies might not have participated in the survey which might leave gaps in the analysis and greatly impact the value of our models. Despite these limitations, EIA data has been used in several analysis reports and can be viewed as a reliable data source for understanding macro trends seen in the United States power grid. 

### Dataset 

TODO: Discuss briefly the data used DONT include the entire list of fields just provide a linke them 
TODO: Decribe each data sheet used. Include the form and description from the EIA site. 
TODO: Include an calcualted fields and discuss the reasoning behind them

Data Cleaning

- Filled in blanks and dots with zeros 
- Dropped any rows with states that were empty or null 
- Dropped all rows that were completly duplicated.. 

In EIA-861 spreadsheets, a dot (.) is not a number and not missing data in the usual sense.
It specifically means:

“Data suppressed / Not available / Not applicable”

This is usually because:

The utility did not report the value

The value was below a disclosure threshold

The value was not applicable to that utility (e.g., they don’t own generation)

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE}

Checklist 

- Summary stats such as national averages, totals, state by state comparisons, etc. 
- plots showing spreads 

short exploratory analysis (summary statistics, histogram/density plot)
before fitting a statistical model. Your model may be guided by this. For example a skewed
density plot may suggest you should transform a variable.



## Research Questions 

1. Can we predict a utility’s total electricity usage in Virginia based on customer type, revenue structure, and purchased power?
2. Can we classify Virginia utilities as “high-demand” vs “normal-demand” based on sales and customer structure? How does this compare across the country? 
3. Unsupervised learning methods: 
  a. Cluster states (VA, GA, TX, OH, OR) based on utility characteristics to see which look like high-data-center (or just high usage) regions
  b. Which utilities in Virginia are outliers in commercial electricity consumption. Identify abnormal utilities whose usage patterns do not match their declared utility type. 


How does data-center-driven load growth in Virginia compare to national utilities, and which statistical learning models best predict future peak demand?

Does the rise of data centers in Virginia change the balance between local power generation and purchased electricity differently than utilities nationwide?

Under different data-center growth scenarios, how could Virginia’s electricity demand, pricing, and grid stress evolve relative to national trends?
